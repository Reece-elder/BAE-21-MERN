# Request Handling

Request Handling is getting data from an API for use with the front end
!GET! <-- Get is getting data and displaying it
POST 
PUT 
PATCH
DELETE 

Request Handling is the user requesting information and the server providing the information
- How can we request the data?
- What do we do with the data? 
- What do we do if the data doesn't load?
- What do we do while waiting for the data? 

We're using Axios for our requests!
Axios - Good with Asynchronous code, simpler than writing the request code yourself

# Tutorial

- install axios `npm i axios`
- find and use a public api
- see what the data looks like
- set up a component to get the data
