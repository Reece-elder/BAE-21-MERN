# Project

Within your teams you are to create the frontend to go with the backend you were working on last week

Front end should be created as a new NPM project hosted on github (SEPARATE REPO) using proper Feature Branch Model 

Should include the following: 
- Routing between pages
- Navbar 
- Footer 
- Correct Component hierarchy 
- Methods of retrieving and posting data:
    - Get By ID 
    - Get All 
    - Post 
    (nice to have):
    - Update and Delete (whatever other stuff you've got in backend)
- Passing of data as props using state to generate components 
- About page, contact us page and home page (don't have to have real data, just a <p> lorem ipsum </p>)
- All of your requests should be done through some kind of menu page
