# Chai

Chai is our assertion library / framework for using Mocha
Gives us assertion functions we can use that return true or false (passing or failing tests)

Set up our npm project
`npm init -y`

Install chai and chai-http - using npm
`npm i chai chai-http`

## Exercise 
Create tests for the following descriptions

'Multiplying 5 by 4 should return 20'
'Should print a string saying "Hello <name>"
'Should return the value of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4'
'The text "hello" should be a string'
'The number 12 should not be undefined' 
'An object should have a property of "name"'
'A text should be null'
