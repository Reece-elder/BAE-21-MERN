# Express Testing

Unit Testing        - Tests independently of eachother
Integration Testing - How functions work together

Testing is the task of running our projects and checking the functions do as we expect them to do

Whilst testing Express, there's only so much code we actually write ourselves 
index.js /server.js - Mainly config
model folder        - Mongoose config
routes folder       - What we're telling our app to do, what we test 

Generally Unit Testing our routes folder 

1) Mocha - Testing framework for JS (Not Mockito dont worry!) equiv - JUnit
2) Chai  - Testing assertion framework                              - Junit Assertion code Assertions.assertEqual("true");
3) Istanbul - Coverage framework
