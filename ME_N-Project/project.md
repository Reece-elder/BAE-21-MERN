You have been hired by a trendy craft beer company to create a Inventory Management system for them

It should be able to do the following:
- Show all beers in the database 
- Show beer by id
- Delete beers (not being sold there) by id
- Create new beers as they're released
- Update the beers by id

This can be done in whatever way the team decides, going for simplicity over style. 

The project should consist of an express backend and a mongodb database, using Postman to access it
Backend code should feature the following: 
- Routes folder, and separate route files
- model folder with separate model files
- Custom middleware for time stamping
- Common middleware for CORS
- Proper schema with proper required and typing conventions

The project should be hosted on GitHub with a proper FBM using pull requests and correct merging practices

Stretch goals:

- Delete beers by queries other than id
- Get all beers by; name, alcohol free, type
- Adding a collection for food (main meals and or snacks)
- mongoDB hosted online with mongoDB atlas
- Improve on the beer model, adding embedded document, arrays to the model

The workload will be split between the team with the following roles: 
- scrum master (arranges the work load)
- product owner (in charge of github)
- backend team
- mongoDB team (maybe?)
