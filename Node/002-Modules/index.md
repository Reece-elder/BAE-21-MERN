# Modules

When using Node.js each JS file is a `Module`
`Modules` are collections of JS kept separate to reduce coupling and increase cohesion

`Modules` can be exported / imported into other JS Modules to access their code

Exercise - Create two new JS files, one exports a string and the other imports it and uses it in a function to print out 

Stretch goal - Create a JS file called calculator.js with calculate functions (add, sub, mul, div) and export them all
- Separate JS file imports the functions and adds their own numbers, exports the sum 
- Separate JS file prints the value
