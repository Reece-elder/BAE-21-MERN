# Node

Node provides a JS Runtime, separating JS from the client and using it for the server side 

Open a terminal in this current location (Right click here > Open in integrated terminal) OR by using powershell

Type node press enter -> "Welcome to Node.js v16" 
When using node you're using a node bash shell (know that because of the >)

When you need to exit node press ctrl + c (cmd + c) OR .exit

using Node, we can tell it to run JS Files

Exercise - Create a JS file that prints out a sentence (with a variable in it)
Run that file using node
