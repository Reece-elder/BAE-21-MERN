# Express

Express is a minimalist framework to handle web functionality in a node.js app
Limited functionality BUT very compatible with custom and extra `middleware`

`Middleware` - Helps communication between two layers, two apps 
Middleware for client <-> server    between two different parts of our backend  

Express gives us a HTTP REQUEST API we can customise, including GET POST PUT DELETE

## Install Express

1) Create a new NPM Project - npm init   (Make faster by using npm init -y use default values for everything)
2) Install express - npm i express / npm install express
3) Install nodemon - npm i -g nodemon 

Exercise - Create a project for the database you were working on yesterday
- Create an index.js that listens to a specific port
- Access the port number on your browser
- Make the server console.log out "hello world" when it starts up
