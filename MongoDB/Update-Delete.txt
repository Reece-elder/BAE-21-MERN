Update our Documents 

Delete our Documents

To update or delete documents you need to be able to specify the document

Update

Rather than using find() we use update()

To update we need to use query operators to find the document to query.

We use $set to update field(s) 

updateOne - finds the first thing and updates it
db.lizard_pen.updateOne(
{
  "name" : "Tom"
},
{ 
  "$set" : { 
             "name" : "Tom",
	     "hasTail": true ,
             "newField" : "yes"		 
           }
}
);

updateMany - Updates all matching fields

db.lizard_pen.updateMany(
{
  "hasTail" : {"$ne" : true}
}, 
{
  "$set" : { "scalyBois" : false }
}
);


Delete

Works in the same way EXCEPT no need to $set

deleteOne - Find the first thing which matches that query (deleting it)
deleteMany - Find all of them

db.lizard_pen.deleteOne(
{
  "length" : { "$lt" : 15 }
});

deleteMany - Deletes EVERYTHING that matches the query

db.lizard_pen.deleteMany({});

Exercises 
- Update ONE document changing a field and giving a new field
- Update ALL documents giving them a new field
- Delete one document with a specific query
- Delete all documents with a different query
