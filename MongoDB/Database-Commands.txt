MongoDB Intro 

Local - Database
startup_log - Collection
The data inside are our documents

Creating databases (and editing them) through the command line 
By clicking the MONGOSH terminal at the bottom of the screen

CREATE: 
use db_name

Creates a new database and starts using it
Databases (custom databases) are not visible UNTIL they contain a collection (which has to contain documents)

READ: show dbs    

To see all existing databases


DELETE: db.dropDatabase();

Delete an existing database
When using a database (with use db_name) you can pass in db instead of the name when doing commands 

db.dropDatabase();

UPDATE: 
old_db.copyDatabase('old_db', 'new_db);
use old_db
db.dropDatabase();

copyDatabase is deprecated, use MongoDB docs to see the equivalent

Copy an existing database
use the new database (you just copied) 
deleting the old database 

Exercise - 
Create 2 databases
Show all databases
Delete one of the new databases
