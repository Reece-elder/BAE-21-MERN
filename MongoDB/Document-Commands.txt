MongoDB Structure

Databases - Contain our collections
Collections - Contain our documents
Documents - Key Value Pairs (BSON) for our data 

How to manipulate and query our documents 

Documents are objects of data stored using BSON (less readable version of JSON) 

Documents do not HAVE TO follow a strict schema

CREATE: 

INSERT command 
InsertOne  - Adding one object
InsertMany - Adding many objects

WRITE COMMANDS IN A NOTEPAD / VSCODE / STICKY NOTE
- Easier to see what you did wrong
- Easier to copy and paste 
- Easier to write (with syntax highlighting) 

Create a lizard object and add him to a collection in my database (zoo) 
I havent created my collection yet, just made the db

db.lizard_pen.insertOne(
	{
	
	  JSON OBJECT

	}
);

db.lizard_pen.insertOne(
	{
		"name" : "Andy",
		"species" : "Gecko",
		"length" : 13
	}
);

Exercise: 

Insert a new document into your collection
Your document MUST have atleast 4 key value pairs, atleast 1 String and 1 number 

Access the new document through the GUI

Stretch goal 
- Adding a boolean value pair
- Adding an array value pair
