Projection - Telling MongoDB what fields you want to see

If Database has 100 documents each with 20 key value pairs, im specifying I want to see 2 of the key value pairs across ALL DOCUMENTS 

db.lizard_pen.find(
  {},
  {
    "name" : true,
    "_id" : false,
    "species" : true 
  }
);

Saying we ONLY want to see the name

_id is shown by default

When projecting a value that ISNT in a document, the document is still shown but ignores the necessary projection 

Equivalent(ish) -> SELECT name, species FROM lizard_pen
